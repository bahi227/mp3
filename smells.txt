Question 1
	hudson.model.UpdateCenter, lines 558-568 repeated
	This code smell is an example of a duplicated code and can be fixed by 
		taking the duplicated code and making a new function or method
		based on those duplicated lines

Question 2
	Jenkins.model.Nodes, jenkins.updateComputerList(); jenkins.trimLabel();
	New method created of two lines commonly called together

Question 3 
	Does this new updateAndTrim method belong to Nodes class?
	Depends on how it was fixed, but since it only calls two functions associated with 
		a different class, it doesn't have to be and probably shouldn't be
	Code smell - non-localized as it is a function that has effects in a different
		class than the one its called in

Question 4
	jenkins.model.IdStrategy, repeated code
	Eliminate repeated code by creating a new method which runs the code, and then 
		call the method rather than repeating the code
		However, the breaks stop that, as it needs to break a different loop
		Instead, a for loop with a condition to ensure it hasn't reached any
		of the breaks in the if statement. 
		Also, tests added for ensuring refactoring didn't add any bugs

Question 5
	hudson.cli.Connection, repeated lines
	Generated function generateKeyPairWithSpec() for repeated lines

Question 6
	PMD detected one such code smell copied below

   </duplication>

	A method was extracted from the duplicated code (from FreeStyleProject paramProject to the end of the assertEquals), to avoid duplicated code
