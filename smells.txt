Question 1
	hudson.model.UpdateCenter, lines 558-568 repeated
	This code smell is an example of a duplicated code and can be fixed by 
		taking the duplicated code and making a new function or method
		based on those duplicated lines

Question 2
	Jenkins.model.Nodes, jenkins.updateComputerList(); jenkins.trimLabel();
	New method created of two lines commonly called together

Question 3 
	Does this new updateAndTrim method belong to Nodes class?
	Depends on how it was fixed, but since it only calls two functions associated with 
		a different class, it doesn't have to be and probably shouldn't be
	Code smell - non-localized as it is a function that has effects in a different
		class than the one its called in
