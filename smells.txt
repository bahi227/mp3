Question 1
	hudson.model.UpdateCenter, lines 558-568 repeated
	This code smell is an example of a duplicated code and can be fixed by 
		taking the duplicated code and making a new function or method
		based on those duplicated lines

Question 2
	Jenkins.model.Nodes, jenkins.updateComputerList(); jenkins.trimLabel();
	New method created of two lines commonly called together

Question 3 
	Does this new updateAndTrim method belong to Nodes class?
	Depends on how it was fixed, but since it only calls two functions associated with 
		the class, it doesn't have to be
	Code smell - speculative generality? or possibly non-localized as it is a function 
		thats basically only called in one class but doesn't belong to it
